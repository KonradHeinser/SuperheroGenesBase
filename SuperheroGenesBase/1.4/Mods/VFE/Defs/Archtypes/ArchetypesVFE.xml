        <label>psionist</label>
        <description>Psionists have an innate connection to the psychic fields many royals use. This connection allows them to manipulate psychic energy far better than any human should be able to. This will give them an innate psylink to utilize their power.\n\nIf this gene is lost at any point, the psylink will go with it, though the abilities will remain. All psionic paths require this gene, and multiple paths can be used at the same time.\n\nMost superheroes have some archetype that they follow, from those that specialize in melee combat to those who specialize in burning everything to the ground. The specific name an archetype goes by often varies, but their overall abilities seldom change. Supers with an archetype usually aren't as burdened by the abilities that come with it, and often don't require the prerequisites that some abilities normally require. The effects, and side effects, of the abilities remain the same.</description>

        <description>Phantoms are master assassins, capable of ignoring every minefield and barricade in their way, while also having the ability to camouflage themselves in any environment. When their invisibility falls, they become easier to stop, but by then it may be too late.\n\nMost superheroes have some archetype that they follow, from those that specialize in melee combat to those who specialize in burning everything to the ground.
