        <label>fear susceptibility</label>
        <description>How well this creature resists fear caused by the Superhero Genes mod. The lower this is, the less susceptibile the pawn is to fear.\n\nThis will have a different effect depending on what the source is. If the fear source is an ability, then this impacts how long the ability lasts for that particular pawn. If the source is a damaging attack, then this will influence how much fear increases per attack. Fear from an ability and an attack create separate hediffs, which means blood pumping can be increased by both, but the chances of mental breaks is also increased.</description>
