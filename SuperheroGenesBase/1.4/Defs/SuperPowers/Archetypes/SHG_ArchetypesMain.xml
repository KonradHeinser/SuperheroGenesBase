        <description>Skirmishers tend to be extremely hard to pin down due to their dextrous nature. They leap in and out of battles with ease, and while it is minor, their ability to predict the actions of everyone near them makes them a deadly force. Lightly equipped Skirmishers will often leap to the back lines to tear apart the enemy's ranged troops, while heavily equipped Skirmishers will wade through enemies, leaping out of the way just before things really get dangerous.\n\nMost superheroes have some archetype that they follow, from those that specialize in melee combat to those who specialize in burning everything to the ground. The specific name an archetype goes by often varies, but their overall abilities seldom change. Supers with an archetype usually aren't as burdened by the abilities that come with it, and often don't require the prerequisites that some abilities normally require. The effects, and side effects, of the abilities remain the same.</description>

        <label>hemomancer</label>
        <description>Hemomancers, contrary to popular belief, don't gain their abilities from being superheroes, but from a mutated version of the hemogenic gene. This mutation initially caused extreme bloodlust, but that was removed about a decade later by introducing small portions of the superhero gene. The final version of the gene contains just enough of the superhero gene directly inside it to allow hemomancers to be classified as superheroes without actually having the superhero gene.\n\nThe prerequisite for this gene is Hemogenic, not the Superhero Gene. There will be powers in the future that require this.\n\nMost superheroes have some archetype that they follow, from those that specialize in melee combat to those who specialize in burning everything to the ground.
