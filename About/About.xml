Ever wanted your pawns to be able to lift extreme weights or research things at frankly ridiculous speeds? This mod allows you to give pawns various super powers that, much like in superhero movies, allows them to ignore the laws of common sense without becoming so overpowered nothing can touch them.

[url=https://github.com/KonradHeinser/SuperheroGenesBase/wiki]This wiki gives more in-depth details about what this mod contains.[/url]

This mod probably won't cause issues if added mid-game, and probably will cause issues if removed mid-game.
_______________________________________________________

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3088653906]Superhero Genes - Villain and Stereotypes[/url] adds xenotypes that use these genes and a hostile faction. It's separate from this one so that people don't have a bunch of extra xenotypes filling their list, or a hostile faction of strong opponents disrupting their colony constantly.
    
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3321596781]Superhero Genes - Hero Organization[/url] adds non-evil super factions, and for those with royalty it adds a few quests including one to two end-game quests.
