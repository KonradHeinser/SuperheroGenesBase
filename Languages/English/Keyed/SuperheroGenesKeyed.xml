    <SHG_CondensedMeteors>    Allow Condensed Meteors (Restart Required)</SHG_CondensedMeteors>
    <SHG_CondensedMeteorsDescription>Allows the condensed summons(i.e condensed steel, condensed jade, and condensed components) to appear as rare meteors. If enabled and a meteor lands, it's recommended that you DON'T mine it all immediately for obvious reasons (colony wealth increases).</SHG_CondensedMeteorsDescription>

    <SHG_ExpensiveBase>    Expensive Base (Restart Required)</SHG_ExpensiveBase>
    <SHG_ExpensiveBaseDescription>Sets the superhero base gene to have a metabolic efficiency of -8(equal to the bonus gained through taking all of the unsuper genes), and adds a dormant super archetype that is the equivalent of taking all the unsuper genes at once.</SHG_ExpensiveBaseDescription>

    <SHG_SupersEverywhere>    Supers Everywhere (Restart Required)</SHG_SupersEverywhere>
    <SHG_SupersEverywhereDescription>Makes all non-custom xenotypes gain the superhero base gene, and exchange some of their negative genes for their more severe antisuper counterparts. This will also catch xenotypes added by other mods, but because it always errs on the higher metabolic efficiency side, you may end up with some xenotypes with more than +5 metabolic efficiency. I have made some patches to correct some mods, but let me know if there's a particularly aggregious one you'd like taken care of.</SHG_SupersEverywhereDescription>

    <SHG_ActivatableSuperGenes>    Activatable Super Genes (Restart Required)</SHG_ActivatableSuperGenes>
    <SHG_ActivatableSuperGenesDescription>Instead of having all the genes give a bunch of constant bonuses, the bonuses are locked behind an ability that must be activated to receive those boons. If active long enough, the pawn will begin gaining increasing boosts to their consciousness, and ever increasing risk of heart attack. It takes half a day for the side effects to begin appearing.</SHG_ActivatableSuperGenesDescription>
    <SHG_InterruptibleActivatables>        Interruptible Activatables (Restart Required)</SHG_InterruptibleActivatables>
    <SHG_InterruptibleActivatablesDescription>Instead of activating almost instantly, the abilities take 10 seconds to activate, making it much harder to use them mid battle.</SHG_InterruptibleActivatablesDescription>

    <SHG_MiddleGrounds>    Middle Ground Basic Super Genes (Restart Required)</SHG_MiddleGrounds>
    <SHG_MiddleGroundsDescription>Adds a second option for all of the basic super and antisuper genes. This adds 16 new genes.</SHG_MiddleGroundsDescription>
    <SHG_AllGrounds>        All Ground Basic Super Genes (Restart Required)</SHG_AllGrounds>
    <SHG_AllGroundsDescription>Extends the options for all of the basic super and antisuper genes to the maximum extent. This adds 27 new genes in addition to the 16 added by middle ground, for a total of 43 new genes.</SHG_AllGroundsDescription>

        <!--AI Settings-->
    <SHG_SuperAI>    Autocast Abilities (Restart Required for any changes)</SHG_SuperAI>
    <SHG_SuperAIDescription>This causes colonists to automatically try to use some of their super abilities when appropriate. This is disabled by default for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, some may not like the idea of having the pawns they are supposed to be controlling doing things on their own.\n\nSecond, this can cause the game to run slower due to the game needing to process more things by itself.\n\nAnd the last reason is that, as many of us have probably noticed, AIs have a tendency of getting caught up on the weirdest stuff, acting in ways that don't quite make sense and making it harder for you to play the game.\n\nMost abilities will not try to activate if the pawn is drafted, and some of them will interrupt you in specific situations(i.e. If autocast healing is enabled, the pawn has a sealing abiltity, and they are bleeding, they will first try to seal their wounds with said ability).</SHG_SuperAIDescription>

    <SHG_AllowPoolUsage>    Allow Life Pool Usage</SHG_AllowPoolUsage>
    <SHG_AllowPoolUsageDescription>Some abilities grant powerful bonuses in the short term, but cause the super to have various debuffs afterwards. If this disabled, then these abilities will never be autocast.</SHG_AllowPoolUsageDescription>

    <SHG_AutomaticHealer>    Autocast Healing</SHG_AutomaticHealer>
    <SHG_AutomaticHealerDescription>Makes multiple healing abilities automatically cast, along with the basic revive ability.\n\nYou will no longer be able to manually use revive, though it shouldn't be an issue as the pawn will automatically go revive people whenever there aren't enemies on the map to interrupt the lengthy process. The few situations where I needed a revive mid-combat, I manage one due to constantly getting shot.</SHG_AutomaticHealerDescription>
