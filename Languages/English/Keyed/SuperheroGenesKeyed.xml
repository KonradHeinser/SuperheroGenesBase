    <SHG_ModName>Superhero Genes - Base</SHG_ModName>

    <SHG_CondensedMeteors>    Allow Condensed Meteors (Restart Required)</SHG_CondensedMeteors>
    <SHG_CondensedMeteorsDescription>Allows the condensed summons(i.e condensed steel, condensed jade, and condensed components) to appear as rare meteors. If enabled and a meteor lands, it's recommended that you DON'T mine it all immediately for obvious reasons (colony wealth increases).</SHG_CondensedMeteorsDescription>

    <SHG_ExpensiveBase>    Expensive Base (Restart Required)</SHG_ExpensiveBase>
    <SHG_ExpensiveBaseDescription>Sets the superhero base gene to have a metabolic efficiency of -8(equal to the bonus gained through taking all of the unsuper genes), and adds a dormant super archetype that is the equivalent of taking all the unsuper genes at once.</SHG_ExpensiveBaseDescription>

    <SHG_SupersEverywhere>    Supers Everywhere (Restart Required)</SHG_SupersEverywhere>
    <SHG_SupersEverywhereDescription>Makes all non-custom xenotypes gain the superhero base gene, and exchange some of their negative genes for their more severe antisuper counterparts. This will also catch xenotypes added by other mods, but because it always errs on the higher metabolic efficiency side, you may end up with some xenotypes with more than +5 metabolic efficiency. I have made some patches to correct some mods, but let me know if there's a particularly aggregious one you'd like taken care of.</SHG_SupersEverywhereDescription>

    <SHG_ActivatableSuperGenes>    Activatable Super Genes (Restart Required)</SHG_ActivatableSuperGenes>
    <SHG_ActivatableSuperGenesDescription>Instead of having all the genes give a bunch of constant bonuses, the bonuses are locked behind an ability that must be activated to receive those boons. If active long enough, the pawn will begin gaining increasing boosts to their consciousness, and ever increasing risk of heart attack. It takes half a day for the side effects to begin appearing.</SHG_ActivatableSuperGenesDescription>
    <SHG_InterruptibleActivatables>        Interruptible Activatables (Restart Required)</SHG_InterruptibleActivatables>
    <SHG_InterruptibleActivatablesDescription>Instead of activating almost instantly, the abilities take 10 seconds to activate, making it much harder to use them mid battle.</SHG_InterruptibleActivatablesDescription>

    <SHG_MiddleGrounds>    Middle Ground Basic Super Genes (Restart Required)</SHG_MiddleGrounds>
    <SHG_MiddleGroundsDescription>Adds a second option for all of the basic super and antisuper genes. This adds 16 new genes.</SHG_MiddleGroundsDescription>
    <SHG_AllGrounds>        All Ground Basic Super Genes (Restart Required)</SHG_AllGrounds>
    <SHG_AllGroundsDescription>Extends the options for all of the basic super and antisuper genes to the maximum extent. This adds 27 new genes in addition to the 16 added by middle ground, for a total of 43 new genes.</SHG_AllGroundsDescription>

        <!--AI Settings-->
    <SHG_SuperAI>Autocast Abilities (Restart Required for any changes)</SHG_SuperAI>
    <SHG_SuperAIDescription>This causes colonists to automatically try to use some of their super abilities when appropriate. This is disabled by default for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, some may not like the idea of having the pawns they are supposed to be controlling doing things on their own.\n\nSecond, this can cause the game to run slower due to the game needing to process more things by itself.\n\nAnd the last reason is that, as many of us have probably noticed, AIs have a tendency of getting caught up on the weirdest stuff, acting in ways that don't quite make sense and making it harder for you to play the game.\n\nMost abilities will not try to activate if the pawn is drafted, but some of them will interrupt you in specific situations(i.e. If autocast healing is enabled, the pawn has a sealing abiltity, and they are bleeding, they will first try to seal their wounds with said ability).\n\nSecond note, while Hemomancer and Psionist abilities are on the automated lists, they are the last ones used. The order of abilities chosen is Generic Powers > Psionic Powers > Hemomantic Powers > Pool Consuming Powers(if enabled).</SHG_SuperAIDescription>

    <SHG_AllowPoolUsage>    Allow Life Pool Usage</SHG_AllowPoolUsage>
    <SHG_AllowPoolUsageDescription>Some abilities grant powerful bonuses in the short term, but cause the super to have various debuffs afterwards. If this disabled, then these abilities will never be autocast.</SHG_AllowPoolUsageDescription>

    <SHG_AutomaticHealer>    Autocast Healing</SHG_AutomaticHealer>
    <SHG_AutomaticHealerDescription>Makes multiple healing abilities automatically cast, along with the basic revive ability. This will also include the vanilla Coagulate ability as one of the last resort ability-based healing methods.\n\nYou may occassionally be unable to stop a pawn that's reviving a colonist by drafting them due to the nature of the ability. Revival will only be attempted while the pawn is undrafted and there are no enemies on the map. The pawn will also revive forbidden colonist corpses, so you don't need to worry about one being missed that way. If you want to dispose of the corpse rather than revive it, you will need to keep the reviver drafted or manually busy as your other colonists deal with the corpse.</SHG_AutomaticHealerDescription>

    <SHG_AutomaticDefense>    Autocast Defense</SHG_AutomaticDefense>
    <SHG_AutomaticDefenseDescription>Makes multiple defensive abilities automatically cast while the pawn is undrafted. If the pawn is undrafted and finds enemies nearby, then it will use the defensive abilities it has based on the situation. For example, if the pawn is shot at while they have a smokescreen-like ability, said ability may be used to minimize the chances of getting shot more. This will only attempt to use specific abilities from Superhero Genes.</SHG_AutomaticDefenseDescription>
    <SHG_AutomaticDefenseDrafted>        Drafted Auto-Defense</SHG_AutomaticDefenseDrafted>
    <SHG_AutomaticDefenseDraftedDescription>Pawns will try to use the same abiilties as they would while undrafted in a dangerous situation. This is a separate option because you may encounter situations where pawns will ignore your commands for a couple seconds to use their defensive abilities. The pawn will avoid using abilties if they already have a defensive ability active to ensure they don't just stand there repeatedly buffing themselves when you need them to shoot something.</SHG_AutomaticDefenseDraftedDescription>

    <SHG_AutomaticBuffs>    Autocast Buffs</SHG_AutomaticBuffs>
    <SHG_AutomaticBuffsDescription>While the pawn is undrafted, they will automatically use their hediff adding beneficial abilties as they see fit. If the pawn has stacking abilities (like the hemo-warriors armor buffs), they fall under this category and are only used if A) they don't have a cost, or B) the related resource has reached high enough levels that the AI assumes it's fine. The AI will always seek to keep stacking buffs at their highest levels, but will otherwise ignore them.\n\nPool abilities will never be used by this, even if that setting is enabled. This is to minimize having the AI do something that makes no sense. Drafted pawns also will not use these abilities for the same reason.</SHG_AutomaticBuffsDescription>

    <SHG_AutomaticDebuff>    Autocast Debuff</SHG_AutomaticDebuff>
    <SHG_AutomaticDebuffDescription>Makes multiple debuffing abilities automatically cast while the pawn is undrafted. If the pawn is undrafted and finds enemies nearby, then it will use the debuffing abilities it has against the pawn they are targetting.</SHG_AutomaticDebuffDescription>
    <SHG_AutomaticDebuffDrafted>        Drafted Auto-Debuff</SHG_AutomaticDebuffDrafted>
    <SHG_AutomaticDebuffDraftedDescription>Pawns will try to use the same abiilties as they would while undrafted in a dangerous situation. This is a separate option because you may encounter situations where pawns will ignore your commands for a couple seconds to use their debuffing abilities. The pawn will avoid using abilties if their target already has the debuffing ability active to ensure they don't just stand there repeatedly debuffing the enemy with the same ability.</SHG_AutomaticDebuffDraftedDescription>

    <SHG_AutomaticOffense>    Autocast Offense</SHG_AutomaticOffense>
    <SHG_AutomaticOffenseDescription>Makes multiple offensive abilities automatically cast while the pawn is undrafted. If the pawn is undrafted and finds enemies nearby, then it will use the offensive abilities it has based on the situation. For example, if their enemy doesn't have any of the pawn's allies nearby, it may choose to use a blast power instead of a bolt.\n\nTo avoid accidents powers that can set things on fire are excluded from this.</SHG_AutomaticOffenseDescription>
    <SHG_AutomaticOffenseDrafted>        Drafted Auto-Offense</SHG_AutomaticOffenseDrafted>
    <SHG_AutomaticOffenseDraftedDescription>Pawns will try to use the same abiilties as they would while undrafted in a dangerous situation. This is a separate option because you may encounter situations where pawns will ignore your commands for a couple seconds to use their offensive abilities, even if said orders are to run away from a situation.</SHG_AutomaticOffenseDraftedDescription>

    <SHG_AutomaticFleeing>    Autocast Fleeing Abilities</SHG_AutomaticFleeing>
    <SHG_AutomaticFleeingDescription>While the pawn is undrafted, they will automatically try to flee when the situation warrants it. If they are actively fleeing, or their health drops below 50%, then they will use whatever escape abilities they have at their disposal, from blink to invisibility to leaping away. This includes the vanilla longjump legs as a method of last resort.</SHG_AutomaticFleeingDescription>
