        ///  2) If remove removeGenesFromOtherLists is true, the program will iterate through all available lists, and remove any genes that the pawn has.
        ///    2.5) If removeGenesFromOtherLists is false, then all of the sets are checked for an override. If a set has an override, then that set is still removed from the pawn if the pawn has any of them.
        ///  3) Genes from alwaysAddedGenes that the pawn doesn't have are added to the pawn.
        ///  4) Genes from the selected set that the pawn doesn't have are added to the pawn.
        ///  5) Genes from alwaysRemovedGenes that the pawn has are removed from the pawn. If a gene is giving this hediff, and you want it removed, I recommend making it last on this list.
        ///  6) Hediff is removed
        /// 
        /// One of the reasons this was added to a hediffcomp instead of a gene extension to make it easier for fellow modders to create items that add items that add genes to pawns with items
        /// If you need an example of this, take a look at Superhero Genes - Deus Ex Machina. If that doesn't exist yet, welcome to spoiler town again!
