The original version of this gene was so destructive that it had to be intentionally weakened to avoid destroying everything in an area similar to an antigrain warhead.</description>

        <label>petrification blast</label>
        <description>Supers with this power are able to summon a ball of infused stone that will invade a targets bloodstream like a toxin.\n\nPetrification will not kill a target and gradually wears off. It is primarily for disabling people you want to capture.\n\nPetrification will have less effect on larger pawns/animals, along with any pawn that has innate blunt armor protection. The original version of this gene was so destructive that it had to be intentionally weakened because it would petrify far too many people for far too long.\n\nPawns with the Super Durability gene are completely immune to this, and pawns with a strong enough innate armor, whether due to genes or implants, are almost impossible to completely petrify, though they will still be slowed.</description>

        <description>Supers with this power are able to shoot a ball of pressurized water that causes some damage on explosion and puts out fires. This also leaves a weird watery foam on the target that makes them feel uncomfortable, while also creating a firefoam-like layer over their body that prevents them from catching fire again for a time.</description>
