        <label>fire burst</label>
        <description>Carriers of this gene are able to set everything in the area around them on fire.\n\nThis doesn't render you immune to fire, so remember to get protection. This is exceptionally important for this ability as even the user will be affected.\n\nBurst genes were originally created to give supers a way to fight a large number of enemies. Most of them were designed to kick up a dust cloud to protect the super some while they deal with nearby enemies. This gene was one of the few exceptions as there would be little need to deal with nearby enemies while they are a little distracted trying to stop being on fire.</description>

        <label>petrification burst</label>
        <description>Carriers of this gene are able to release a burst of infused stone dust that invades the blood streams of everyone in the area around tham, including themselves, like a toxin. The dust collects around veins and muscles, gradually restricting the individual's ability to move freely as it becomes denser.\n\nPetrification will not kill a target and gradually wears off. It is primarily for disabling people you want to capture. People will not become completely petrified by a single burst, and any pawns with a larger body size or innate blunt armor will be somewhat resistant to petrification. The innate armor this gene provides will protect the pawn from petrifying completely, but it will not stop the effects entirely.\n\nBurst genes were originally created to give supers a way to fight a large number of enemies.
