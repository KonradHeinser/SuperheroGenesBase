        <description>A pill that gives the pawn the superhero base gene along with some genes that turn them into super geniuses or super persuasive individuals.  Pawns that ingest a variety of these pills are prone to occassionally suffer unpredictable and irreversable effects on their genetic code, with the most common ones involving the pill erasing or suppressing parts of the genome. Consuming the same pill mutiple times has weaker but more consistent side effects as the pill only allows for one of its super types to take effect.\n\nThe genes will be inheritable, even if the pawn's other genes are not.</description>
